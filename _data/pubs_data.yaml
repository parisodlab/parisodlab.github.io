- Abstract: The consequences of whole-genome duplication (WGD) remain elusive. A new
    study by Ebadi et al. simulating duplicated gene networks predicts that WGD immediately
    generates autopolyploids with extreme phenotypes and increases phenotypic variance.
    Such theoretical work calls for new experimental studies addressing to what extent
    WGD may be beneficial under environmental changes.

  Title: Duplicated gene networks promote 'hopeful' phenotypic variation
- Abstract: "Recombination and selection drive the extent of linkage disequilibrium\
    \ (LD) among loci and therefore affect the reshuffling of adaptive genetic variation.\
    \ However, it is poorly known to what extent the enrichment of transposable elements\
    \ (TEs) in recombinationally-inert regions reflects their inefficient removal\
    \ by purifying selection and whether the presence of polymorphic TEs can modify\
    \ the local recombination rate. In this study, we investigate how TEs and recombination\
    \ interact at fine scale along chromosomes and possibly support linked selection\
    \ in natural populations. Whole-genome sequencing data of 304 individuals from\
    \ nearby alpine populations of Arabis alpina were used to show that the density\
    \ of polymorphic TEs is specifically correlated with local LD along chromosomes.\
    \ Consistent with TEs modifying recombination, the characterization of 28 such\
    \ LD blocks of up to 5.5\_Mb in length revealed strong evidence of selective sweeps\
    \ at a few loci through either site frequency spectrum or haplotype structure.\
    \ A majority of these blocks were enriched in genes related to ecologically relevant\
    \ functions such as responses to cold, salt stress or photoperiodism. In particular,\
    \ the S-locus (i.e., supergene responsible for strict outcrossing) was identified\
    \ in a LD block with high levels of polymorphic TEs and evidence of selection.\
    \ Another such LD block was enriched in cold-responding genes and presented evidence\
    \ of adaptive loci related to photoperiodism and flowering being increasingly\
    \ linked by polymorphic TEs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis\
    \ that TEs modify recombination landscapes and thus interact with selection in\
    \ driving blocks of linked adaptive loci in natural populations."
