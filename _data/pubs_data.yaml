- Abstract: The molecular underpinnings and consequences of cycles of whole-genome
    duplication (WGD) and subsequent gene loss through subgenome fractionation remain
    largely elusive. Endogenous drivers, such as transposable elements (TEs), have
    been postulated to shape genome-wide dominance and biased fractionation, leading
    to a conserved least-fractionated (LF) subgenome and a degenerated most-fractionated
    (MF) subgenome. In contrast, the role of exogenous factors, such as those induced
    by environmental stresses, has been overlooked. In this study, a chromosome-scale
    assembly of the alpine buckler mustard (Biscutella laevigata; Brassicaceae) that
    underwent a WGD event about 11 million years ago is coupled with transcriptional
    responses to heat, cold, drought, and herbivory to assess how gene expression
    is associated with differential gene retention across the MF and LF subgenomes.
    Counteracting the impact of TEs in reducing the expression and retention of nearby
    genes across the MF subgenome, dosage balance is highlighted as a main endogenous
    promoter of the retention of duplicated gene products under purifying selection.
    Consistent with the "turn a hobby into a job" model, about one-third of environment-responsive
    duplicates exhibit novel expression patterns, with one copy typically remaining
    conditionally expressed, whereas the other copy has evolved constitutive expression,
    highlighting exogenous factors as a major driver of gene retention. Showing uneven
    patterns of fractionation, with regions remaining unbiased, but with others showing
    high bias and significant enrichment in environment-responsive genes, this mesopolyploid
    genome presents evolutionary signatures consistent with an interplay of endogenous
    and exogenous factors having driven gene content following WGD-fractionation cycles.

  Title: Biased Retention of Environment-Responsive Genes Following Genome Fractionation
- Abstract: The consequences of whole-genome duplication (WGD) remain elusive. A new
    study by Ebadi et al. simulating duplicated gene networks predicts that WGD immediately
    generates autopolyploids with extreme phenotypes and increases phenotypic variance.
    Such theoretical work calls for new experimental studies addressing to what extent
    WGD may be beneficial under environmental changes.

  Title: Duplicated gene networks promote 'hopeful' phenotypic variation
- Abstract: "Landscape genomic analyses associating genetic variation with environmental\
    \ variables are powerful tools for studying molecular signatures of species' local\
    \ adaptation and for detecting candidate genes under selection. The development\
    \ of landscape genomics over the past decade has been spurred by improvements\
    \ in resolutions of genomic and environmental datasets, allegedly increasing the\
    \ power to identify putative genes underlying local adaptation in non-model organisms.\
    \ Although these associations have been successfully applied to numerous species\
    \ across a diverse array of taxa, the spatial scale of environmental predictor\
    \ variables has been largely overlooked, potentially limiting conclusions to be\
    \ reached with these methods. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically\
    \ evaluated performances of genotype-environment association (GEA) models using\
    \ predictor variables at multiple spatial resolutions. Specifically, we used multivariate\
    \ redundancy analyses to associate whole-genome sequence data from the plant Arabis\
    \ alpina L. collected across four neighboring valleys in the western Swiss Alps,\
    \ with very high-resolution topographic variables derived from digital elevation\
    \ models of grain sizes between 0.5\u2009m and 16\u2009m. These comparisons highlight\
    \ the sensitivity of landscape genomic models to spatial resolution, where the\
    \ optimal grain sizes were specific to variable type, terrain characteristics,\
    \ and study extent. To assist in selecting variables at appropriate spatial resolutions,\
    \ we demonstrate a practical approach to produce, select, and integrate multiscale\
    \ variables into GEA models. After generalizing fine-grained variables to multiple\
    \ spatial resolutions, a forward selection procedure is applied to retain only\
    \ the most relevant variables for a particular context. Depending on the spatial\
    \ resolution, the relevance for topographic variables in GEA studies calls for\
    \ integrating multiple spatial scales into landscape genomic models. By carefully\
    \ considering spatial resolutions, candidate genes under selection by a more realistic\
    \ range of pressures can be detected for downstream analyses, with important applied\
    \ implications for experimental research and conservation management of natural\
    \ populations."

- Abstract: Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is the movement of DNA between organisms without
    sexual reproduction. The acquired genes represent genetic novelties that have
    independently evolved in the donor's genome. Phylogenetic methods have shown that
    LGT is widespread across the entire grass family, although we know little about
    the underlying dynamics. We identify laterally acquired genes in five de novo
    reference genomes from the same grass genus (four Alloteropsis semialata and one
    Alloteropsis angusta). Using additional resequencing data for a further 40 Alloteropsis
    individuals, we place the acquisition of each gene onto a phylogeny using stochastic
    character mapping, and then infer rates of gains and losses. We detect 168 laterally
    acquired genes in the five reference genomes (32-100 per genome). Exponential
    decay models indicate that the rate of LGT acquisitions (6-28 per Ma) and subsequent
    losses (11-24% per Ma) varied significantly among lineages. Laterally acquired
    genes were lost at a higher rate than vertically inherited loci (0.02-0.8% per
    Ma). This high turnover creates intraspecific gene content variation, with a preponderance
    of them occurring as accessory genes in the Alloteropsis pangenome. This rapid
    turnover generates standing variation that can ultimately fuel local adaptation.

- Abstract: 'As species expand their geographic ranges, colonizing populations face
    novel ecological conditions, such as new environments and limited mates, and suffer
    from evolutionary consequences of demographic change through bottlenecks and mutation
    load accumulation. Self-fertilization is often observed at species range edges
    and, in addition to countering the lack of mates, is hypothesized as an evolutionary
    advantage against load accumulation through increased homozygosity and purging.
    We study how selfing impacts the accumulation of genetic load during range expansion
    via purging and/or speed of colonization. Using simulations, we disentangle inbreeding
    effects due to demography versus due to selfing and find that selfers expand faster,
    but still accumulate load, regardless of mating system. The severity of variants
    contributing to this load, however, differs across mating system: higher selfing
    rates purge large-effect recessive variants leaving a burden of smaller-effect
    alleles. We compare these predictions to the mixed-mating plant Arabis alpina,
    using whole-genome sequences from refugial outcrossing populations versus expanded
    selfing populations. Empirical results indicate accumulation of expansion load
    along with evidence of purging in selfing populations, concordant with our simulations,
    suggesting that while purging is a benefit of selfing evolving during range expansions,
    it is not sufficient to prevent load accumulation due to range expansion.'

- Abstract: Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are soil-dwelling parasitic roundworms
    commonly used as biocontrol agents of insect pests in agriculture. EPN dauer juveniles
    locate and infect a host in which they will grow and multiply until resource depletion.
    During their free-living stage, EPNs face a series of internal and environmental
    stresses. Their ability to overcome these challenges is crucial to determine their
    infection success and survival. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview
    of EPN response to stresses associated with starvation, low/elevated temperatures,
    desiccation, osmotic stress, hypoxia, and ultra-violet light. We further report
    EPN defense strategies to cope with biotic stressors such as viruses, bacteria,
    fungi, and predatory insects. By comparing the genetic and biochemical basis of
    these strategies to the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, we provide new
    avenues and targets to select and engineer precision nematodes adapted to specific
    field conditions.

- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Habitat degradation and landscape fragmentation
    dramatically lower population sizes of rare plant species. Decreasing population
    sizes may, in turn, negatively affect genetic diversity and reproductive fitness,
    which can ultimately lead to local extinction of populations. Although such extinction
    vortex dynamics have been postulated in theory and modelling for decades, empirical
    evidence from local extinctions of plant populations is scarce. In particular,
    comparisons between current vs. historical genetic diversity and differentiation
    are lacking despite their potential to guide conservation management.

    METHODS: We studied the population genetic signatures of the local extinction
    of Biscutella laevigata subsp. gracilis populations in Central Germany. We used
    microsatellites to genotype individuals from 15 current populations, one ex situ
    population, and 81 herbarium samples from five extant and 22 extinct populations.
    In the current populations, we recorded population size and fitness proxies, collected
    seeds for a germination trial and conducted a vegetation survey. The latter served
    as a surrogate for habitat conditions to study how habitat dissimilarity affects
    functional connectivity among the current populations.

    KEY RESULTS: Bayesian clustering revealed similar gene pool distribution in current
    and historical samples but also indicated that a distinct genetic cluster was
    significantly associated with extinction probability. Gene flow was affected by
    both the spatial distance and floristic composition of population sites, highlighting
    the potential of floristic composition as a powerful predictor of functional connectivity
    which may promote decision-making for reintroduction measures. For an extinct
    population, we found a negative relationship between sampling year and heterozygosity.
    Inbreeding negatively affected germination.

    CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the usefulness of historical DNA to study extinction
    vortices in threatened species. Our novel combination of classical population
    genetics together with data from herbarium specimens, an ex situ population and
    a germination trial underlines the need for genetic rescue measures to prevent
    extinction of B. laevigata in Central Germany.'

- Abstract: Relative contributions of pre-existing vs de novo genomic variation to
    adaptation are poorly understood, especially in polyploid organisms. We assess
    this in high resolution using autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa, which repeatedly
    adapted to toxic serpentine soils that exhibit skewed elemental profiles. Leveraging
    a fivefold replicated serpentine invasion, we assess selection on SNPs and structural
    variants (TEs) in 78 resequenced individuals and discover significant parallelism
    in candidate genes involved in ion homeostasis. We further model parallel selection
    and infer repeated sweeps on a shared pool of variants in nearly all these loci,
    supporting theoretical expectations. A single striking exception is represented
    by TWO PORE CHANNEL 1, which exhibits convergent evolution from independent de
    novo mutations at an identical, otherwise conserved site at the calcium channel
    selectivity gate. Taken together, this suggests that polyploid populations can
    rapidly adapt to environmental extremes, calling on both pre-existing variation
    and novel polymorphisms.

  Title: Parallel adaptation in autopolyploid Arabidopsis arenosa is dominated by

- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Plant genomes can respond rapidly to environmental changes
    and transposable elements (TEs) arise as important drivers contributing to genome
    dynamics. Although some elements were reported to be induced by various abiotic
    or biotic factors, there is a lack of general understanding on how environment
    influences the activity and diversity of TEs. Here, we combined common garden
    experiment with short-read sequencing to investigate genomic abundance and expression
    of 2245 consensus TE sequences (containing retrotransposons and DNA transposons)
    in an alpine environment in Arabidopsis arenosa. To disentangle general trends
    from local differentiation, we leveraged four foothill-alpine population pairs
    from different mountain regions. Seeds of each of the eight populations were raised
    under four treatments that differed in temperature and irradiance, two factors
    varying with elevation. RNA-seq analysis was performed on leaves of young plants
    to test for the effect of elevation and subsequently of temperature and irradiance
    on expression of TE sequences.

    RESULTS: Genomic abundance of the 2245 consensus TE sequences varied greatly between
    the mountain regions in line with neutral divergence among the regions, representing
    distinct genetic lineages of A. arenosa. Accounting for intraspecific variation
    in abundance, we found consistent transcriptomic response for some TE sequences
    across the different pairs of foothill-alpine populations suggesting parallelism
    in TE expression. In particular expression of retrotransposon LTR Copia (e.g.
    Ivana and Ale clades) and LTR Gypsy (e.g. Athila and CRM clades) but also non-LTR
    LINE or DNA transposon TIR MuDR consistently varied with elevation of origin.
    TE sequences responding specifically to temperature and irradiance belonged to
    the same classes as well as additional TE clades containing potentially stress-responsive
    elements (e.g. LTR Copia Sire and Tar, LTR Gypsy Reina).

    CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the A. arenosa genome harbours a considerable
    diversity of TE sequences whose abundance and expression response varies across
    its native range. Some TE clades may contain transcriptionally active elements
    responding to a natural environmental gradient. This may further contribute to
    genetic variation between populations and may ultimately provide new regulatory
    mechanisms to face environmental challenges.'

- Abstract: "The Arctic is one of the most extreme terrestrial environments on the\
    \ planet. Here, we present the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of a plant\
    \ adapted to the high Arctic, Draba nivalis (Brassicaceae), an attractive model\
    \ species for studying plant adaptation to the stresses imposed by this harsh\
    \ environment. We used an iterative scaffolding strategy with data from short-reads,\
    \ single-molecule long reads, proximity ligation data, and a genetic map to produce\
    \ a 302\_Mb assembly that is highly contiguous with 91.6% assembled into eight\
    \ chromosomes (the base chromosome number). To identify candidate genes and gene\
    \ families that may have facilitated adaptation to Arctic environmental stresses,\
    \ we performed comparative genomic analyses with nine non-Arctic Brassicaceae\
    \ species. We show that the D. nivalis genome contains expanded suites of genes\
    \ associated with drought and cold stress (e.g., related to the maintenance of\
    \ oxidation-reduction homeostasis, meiosis, and signaling pathways). The expansions\
    \ of gene families associated with these functions appear to be driven in part\
    \ by the activity of transposable elements. Tests of positive selection identify\
    \ suites of candidate genes associated with meiosis and photoperiodism, as well\
    \ as cold, drought, and oxidative stress responses. Our results reveal a multifaceted\
    \ landscape of stress adaptation in the D. nivalis genome, offering avenues for\

- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hybridization is known to drive plant speciation
    through the establishment of homoploid or allopolyploid hybrid species. Here we
    investigate the origin of Pulmonaria helvetica, a narrow endemic species described
    across a restricted area of Switzerland that was entirely covered by ice during
    the last glacial maximum. This species presents an original number of chromosomes
    (2n = 24) and morphological traits suggestive of a hybrid origin.

    METHODS: We sequenced a plastid locus and 1077 double-digest restriction-site-associated
    DNA (ddRAD) loci in 67 individuals from across the distribution range of P. helvetica
    and candidate progenitor species growing in the same area. Assignment of genotypes
    to main genetic clusters within and among taxa using STRUCTURE tested whether
    P. helvetica represents a genetically differentiated lineage and addressed the
    hypothesis of its hybrid origin. Comparative ecological modelling further addressed
    possible niche differentiation among taxa.

    KEY RESULTS: Pulmonaria helvetica was highlighted as a genetically homogeneous
    species distinct from co-occurring taxa. Consistent with a scenario of hybrid
    speciation, it presented clear evidence of balanced admixture between Pulmonaria
    officinalis (2n = 16) and Pulmonaria mollis s.l. (2n = 18, 22), which was also
    highlighted as a maternal progenitor based on plastid sequences. Limited genetic
    structure within the maternal progenitor is consistent with an origin of P. helvetica
    through either homoploid hybridization with considerable karyotype changes or
    via complex scenarios of allopolyploidy involving a dysploid taxon of P. mollis
    s.l. Comparative niche modelling indicated non-significant ecological differences
    between P. helvetica and its progenitors, supporting intrinsic factors resulting
    from hybridization as main drivers of speciation.

    CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization appears as a major process having promoted the postglacial
    origin of the narrow endemic P. helvetica, suggesting hybrid speciation as an
    effective process that rapidly produces new species under climate changes.'

  Title: Recent hybrid speciation at the origin of the narrow endemic Pulmonaria helvetica
- Abstract: Underpinnings of the distribution of allopolyploid species (hybrids with
    duplicated genome) along spatial and ecological gradients are elusive. As allopolyploid
    speciation combines the range of genetic and ecological characteristics of divergent
    diploids, allopolyploids initially show their additivity and are predicted to
    evolve differentiated ecological niches to establish in face of their competition.
    Here, we use four diploid wild wheats that differentially combined into four independent
    allopolyploid species to test for such additivity and assess the impact of ecological
    constraints on species ranges. Divergent genetic variation from diploids being
    fixed in heterozygote allopolyploids supports their genetic additivity. Spatial
    integration of comparative phylogeography and modelling of climatic niches supports
    ecological additivity of locally adapted diploid progenitors into allopolyploid
    species which subsequently colonised wide ranges. Allopolyploids fill suitable
    range to a larger extent than diploids and conservative evolution following the
    combination of divergent species appears to support their expansion under environmental
    changes.

  Title: Eco-genetic additivity of diploids in allopolyploid wild wheats
- Abstract: "The wheat group offers an outstanding system to address the interplay\
    \ between hybridization, chromosomal evolution and biological diversification.\
    \ Most diploid wild wheats originated following hybridization between the A-genome\
    \ lineage and the B-genome lineage some 4\_Myr ago, resulting in an admixed D-genome\
    \ lineage that presented dramatic radiation accompanied by considerable changes\
    \ in genome size and chromosomal rearrangements. Comparative profiling of low-copy\
    \ genes, repeated sequences and transposable elements among those divergent species\
    \ characterized by different karyotypes highlights high genome dynamics and sheds\
    \ new light on the processes underlying chromosomal evolution in wild wheats.\
    \ One of the hybrid clades presents upsizing of metacentric chromosomes going\
    \ along with the proliferation of specific repeats (i.e. 'genomic obesity'), whereas\
    \ other species show stable genome size associated with increasing chromosomal\
    \ asymmetry. Genetic and ecological variation in those specialized species suggest\
    \ that genome restructuring was coupled with adaptive processes to support the\

  Title: Chromosome restructuring among hybridizing wild wheats
- Abstract: Plants defend themselves against herbivores through the production of
    toxic and deterrent metabolites. Adapted herbivores can tolerate and sometimes
    sequester these metabolites, allowing them to feed on defended plants and become
    toxic to their own enemies. Can herbivore natural enemies overcome sequestered
    plant defense metabolites to prey on adapted herbivores? To address this question,
    we studied how entomopathogenic nematodes cope with benzoxazinoid defense metabolites
    that are produced by grasses and sequestered by a specialist maize herbivore,
    the western corn rootworm. We find that nematodes from US maize fields in regions
    in which the western corn rootworm was present over the last 50 y are behaviorally
    and metabolically resistant to sequestered benzoxazinoids and more infective toward
    the western corn rootworm than nematodes from other parts of the world. Exposure
    of a benzoxazinoid-susceptible nematode strain to the western corn rootworm for
    5 generations results in higher behavioral and metabolic resistance and benzoxazinoid-dependent
    infectivity toward the western corn rootworm. Thus, herbivores that are exposed
    to a plant defense sequestering herbivore can evolve both behavioral and metabolic
    resistance to plant defense metabolites, and these traits are associated with
    higher infectivity toward a defense sequestering herbivore. We conclude that plant
    defense metabolites that are transferred through adapted herbivores may result
    in the evolution of resistance in herbivore natural enemies. Our study also identifies
    plant defense resistance as a potential target for the improvement of biological
    control agents.

- Abstract: "Evolutionary relationships among the Aegilops-Triticum relatives of cultivated\
    \ wheats have been difficult to resolve owing to incomplete lineage sorting and\
    \ reticulate evolution. Recent studies have suggested that the wheat D-genome\
    \ lineage (progenitor of Ae. tauschii) originated through homoploid hybridization\

  Title: Hybridization preceded radiation in diploid wheats
- Abstract: A fundamental tenet of multicellular eukaryotic evolution is that vertical
    inheritance is paramount, with natural selection acting on genetic variants transferred
    from parents to offspring. This lineal process means that an organism's adaptive
    potential can be restricted by its evolutionary history, the amount of standing
    genetic variation, and its mutation rate. Lateral gene transfer (LGT) theoretically
    provides a mechanism to bypass many of these limitations, but the evolutionary
    importance and frequency of this process in multicellular eukaryotes, such as
    plants, remains debated. We address this issue by assembling a chromosome-level
    genome for the grass Alloteropsis semialata, a species surmised to exhibit two
    LGTs, and screen it for other grass-to-grass LGTs using genomic data from 146
    other grass species. Through stringent phylogenomic analyses, we discovered 57
    additional LGTs in the A. semialata nuclear genome, involving at least nine different
    donor species. The LGTs are clustered in 23 laterally acquired genomic fragments
    that are up to 170 kb long and have accumulated during the diversification of
    Alloteropsis. The majority of the 59 LGTs in A. semialata are expressed, and we
    show that they have added functions to the recipient genome. Functional LGTs were
    further detected in the genomes of five other grass species, demonstrating that
    this process is likely widespread in this globally important group of plants.
    LGT therefore appears to represent a potent evolutionary force capable of spreading
    functional genes among distantly related grass species.

  Title: Lateral transfers of large DNA fragments spread functional genes among grasses
- Abstract: "Recombination and selection drive the extent of linkage disequilibrium\
    \ (LD) among loci and therefore affect the reshuffling of adaptive genetic variation.\
    \ However, it is poorly known to what extent the enrichment of transposable elements\
    \ (TEs) in recombinationally-inert regions reflects their inefficient removal\
    \ by purifying selection and whether the presence of polymorphic TEs can modify\
    \ the local recombination rate. In this study, we investigate how TEs and recombination\
    \ interact at fine scale along chromosomes and possibly support linked selection\
    \ in natural populations. Whole-genome sequencing data of 304 individuals from\
    \ nearby alpine populations of Arabis alpina were used to show that the density\
    \ of polymorphic TEs is specifically correlated with local LD along chromosomes.\
    \ Consistent with TEs modifying recombination, the characterization of 28 such\
    \ LD blocks of up to 5.5\_Mb in length revealed strong evidence of selective sweeps\
    \ at a few loci through either site frequency spectrum or haplotype structure.\
    \ A majority of these blocks were enriched in genes related to ecologically relevant\
    \ functions such as responses to cold, salt stress or photoperiodism. In particular,\
    \ the S-locus (i.e., supergene responsible for strict outcrossing) was identified\
    \ in a LD block with high levels of polymorphic TEs and evidence of selection.\
    \ Another such LD block was enriched in cold-responding genes and presented evidence\
    \ of adaptive loci related to photoperiodism and flowering being increasingly\
    \ linked by polymorphic TEs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis\
    \ that TEs modify recombination landscapes and thus interact with selection in\
    \ driving blocks of linked adaptive loci in natural populations."

  Title: Impact of polymorphic transposable elements on linkage disequilibrium along
    chromosomes
- Abstract: Advances in high-throughput sequencing have promoted the collection of
    reference genomes and genome-wide diversity. However, the assessment of genomic
    variation among populations has hitherto mainly been surveyed through single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) and largely ignored the often major fraction of genomes represented
    by transposable elements (TEs). Despite accumulating evidence supporting the evolutionary
    significance of TEs, comprehensive surveys remain scarce. Here, we sequenced the
    full genomes of 304 individuals of Arabis alpina sampled from four nearby natural
    populations to genotype SNPs as well as polymorphic long terminal repeat retrotransposons
    (polymorphic TEs; i.e., presence/absence of TE insertions at specific loci). We
    identified 291,396 SNPs and 20,548 polymorphic TEs, comparing their contributions
    to genomic diversity and divergence across populations. Few SNPs were shared among
    populations and overall showed high population-specific variation, whereas most
    polymorphic TEs segregated among populations. The genomic context of these two
    classes of variants further highlighted candidate adaptive loci having a putative
    impact on functional genes. In particular, 4.96% of the SNPs were identified as
    nonsynonymous or affecting start/stop codons. In contrast, 43% of the polymorphic
    TEs were present next to Arabis genes enriched in functional categories related
    to the regulation of reproduction and responses to biotic as well as abiotic stresses.
    This unprecedented data set, mapping variation gained from SNPs and complementary
    polymorphic TEs within and among populations, will serve as a rich resource for
    addressing microevolutionary processes shaping genome variation.

  Title: Genome-wide variation in nucleotides and retrotransposons in alpine populations
    of Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae)
- Abstract: "The genomic shock hypothesis suggests that allopolyploidy is associated\
    \ with genome changes driven by transposable elements, as a response to imbalances\
    \ between parental insertion loads. To explore this hypothesis, we compared three\
    \ allotetraploids, Nicotiana arentsii, N.\_rustica and N.\_tabacum, which arose\
    \ over comparable time frames from hybridisation between increasingly divergent\
    \ diploid species. We used sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP)\
    \ to compare the dynamics of six transposable elements in these allopolyploids,\
    \ their diploid progenitors and in corresponding synthetic hybrids. We show that\
    \ element-specific dynamics in young Nicotiana allopolyploids reflect their dynamics\
    \ in diploid progenitors. Transposable element mobilisation is not concomitant\
    \ with immediate genome merger, but occurs within the first generations of allopolyploid\
    \ formation. In natural allopolyploids, such mobilisations correlate with imbalances\
    \ in the repeat profile of the parental species, which increases with their genetic\
    \ divergence. Other restructuring leading to locus loss is immediate, nonrandom\
    \ and targeted at specific subgenomes, independently of cross orientation. The\
    \ correlation between transposable element mobilisation in allopolyploids and\
    \ quantitative imbalances in parental transposable element loads supports the\
    \ genome shock hypothesis proposed by McClintock."

  Title: Parental transposable element loads influence their dynamics in young Nicotiana
    hybrids and allotetraploids
- Abstract: Plant species are known to adapt locally to their environment, particularly
    in mountainous areas where conditions can vary drastically over short distances.
    The climate of such landscapes being largely influenced by topography, using fine-scale
    models to evaluate environmental heterogeneity may help detecting adaptation to
    micro-habitats. Here, we applied a multiscale landscape genomic approach to detect
    evidence of local adaptation in the alpine plant Biscutella laevigata. The two
    gene pools identified, experiencing limited gene flow along a 1-km ridge, were
    different in regard to several habitat features derived from a very high resolution
    (VHR) digital elevation model (DEM). A correlative approach detected signatures
    of selection along environmental gradients such as altitude, wind exposure, and
    solar radiation, indicating adaptive pressures likely driven by fine-scale topography.
    Using a large panel of DEM-derived variables as ecologically relevant proxies,
    our results highlighted the critical role of spatial resolution. These high-resolution
    multiscale variables indeed indicate that the robustness of associations between
    genetic loci and environmental features depends on spatial parameters that are
    poorly documented. We argue that the scale issue is critical in landscape genomics
    and that multiscale ecological variables are key to improve our understanding
    of local adaptation in highly heterogeneous landscapes.

  Title: Multiscale landscape genomic models to detect signatures of selection in
    the alpine plant Biscutella laevigata
- Abstract: "Studying hybridization has the potential to elucidate challenging questions\
    \ in evolutionary biology such as the nature of adaptive genetic variation and\
    \ reproductive isolation. A growing body of work highlights that the merging of\
    \ divergent genomes goes beyond the reshuffling of standing variation from related\
    \ species and promotes mutations (Abbott et\_al., ). However, to what extent such\
    \ genome instability generates evolutionary significant variation remains largely\
    \ elusive. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Dennenmoser et\_al. () report considerable\
    \ dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) in a recent invasive fish species of\
    \ hybrid origin (Cottus; Figure\_). It adds to the recent examples from plants\
    \ to support TE-specific genome variation following hybridization. Insights from\
    \ early, as well as established, hybrids are largely coherent with increased TE\
    \ activity, and this fish system thus represents an inspiring opportunity to further\
    \ address the possible association between genome dynamics and \"rapid evolution\
    \ of hybrid species.\" This work based on genome (re)sequencing contrasts with\
    \ prior transcriptomics or PCR-based studies of TEs and illustrates how unprecedented\
    \ amount of information promises a better understanding of the multiple patterns\
    \ of variation across eukaryotic genomes; provided that we get the better of methodological\
    \ advances. As discussed here, unbiased assessment of TE variation from genome\
    \ surveys indeed remains a challenge precluding firm conclusions to be reached\
    \ about the evolutionary significance of TEs. Despite methodological and conceptual\
    \ developments that appear necessary to unambiguously uncover the unexplored iceberg\
    \ below the known tip, the role of coding genes vs. TEs in promoting adaptation\
    \ and speciation might be clarified in a not so remote future."

  Title: 'Jumping genes: Genomic ballast or powerhouse of biological diversification'
- Abstract: Transposable elements support genome diversification, but comparison of
    their proliferation and genomic distribution within and among species is necessary
    to characterize their role in evolution. Such inferences are challenging because
    of potential bias with incomplete sampling of repetitive genome regions. Here,
    using the assembled genome as well as genome skimming datasets in Arabis alpina,
    we assessed the limits of current approaches inferring the biology of transposable
    elements. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) identified in the assembled
    genome were classified into monophyletic lineages (here called tribes), including
    families of similar copies in Arabis along with elements from related Brassicaceae.
    Inference of their dynamics using divergence of LTRs in full-length copies and
    mismatch distribution of genetic variation among all copies congruently highlighted
    recent transposition bursts, although ancient proliferation events were apparent
    only with mismatch distribution. Similar inferences of LTR-RT dynamics based on
    random sequences from genome skimming were highly correlated with assembly-based
    estimates, supporting accurate analyses from shallow sequencing. Proportions of
    LTR-RT copies next to genes from both assembled genomes and genome skimming were
    congruent, pointing to tribes being over- or under-represented in the vicinity
    of genes. Finally, genome skimming at low coverage revealed accurate inferences
    of LTR-RT dynamics and distribution, although only the most abundant families
    appeared robustly analysed at 0.1X. Examining the pitfalls and benefits of approaches
    relying on different genomic resources, we highlight that random sequencing reads
    represent adequate data suitably complementing biased samples of LTR-RT copies
    retrieved from assembled genomes towards comprehensive surveys of the biology
    of transposable elements.

    78 SUMMARY: Recent decades have seen declines of entire plant clades while other
    clades persist despite changing environments. We suggest that one reason why some
    clades persist is that species within these clades use similar habitats, because
    such similarity may increase the degree of co-occurrence of species within clades.
    Traditionally, co-occurrence among clade members has been suggested to be disadvantageous
    because of increased competition and enemy pressure. Here, we hypothesize that
    increased co-occurrence among clade members promotes mutualist exchange, niche
    expansion or hybridization, thereby helping species avoid population decline from
    environmental change. We review the literature and analyse published data for
    hundreds of plant clades (genera) within a well-studied region and find major
    differences in the degree to which species within clades occupy similar habitats.
    We tentatively show that, in clades for which species occupy similar habitats,
    species tend to exhibit increased co-occurrence, mutualism, niche expansion, and
    hybridization - and rarely decline. Consistently, throughout the geological past,
    clades whose species occupied similar habitats often persisted through long time-spans.
    Overall, for many plant species, the occupation of similar habitats among fellow
    clade members apparently reduced their vulnerability to environmental change.
    Future research should identify when and how this previously unrecognized eco-evolutionary
    feedback operates.'

- Abstract: Taking transposable elements into consideration in surveys of genetic
    and epigenetic variation remains challenging in species lacking a high-quality
    reference genome. Here, molecular techniques reducing genome complexity and specifically
    targeting restructuring and methylation changes in TE genome fractions are described.
    In particular, methyl-sensitive transposon display (MSTD) uses isoschizomers and
    PCR amplifications to assess the methylation environment of TE insertions. MSTD
    offers reliable insights into genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with TEs,
    especially when used together with similar techniques tracking random sequences.

  Title: Towards unified hypotheses of the impact of polyploidy on ecological niches
- Abstract: The maintenance of species integrity despite pervasive hybridization is
    ruled by the interplay between reproductive barriers. Endogenous postzygotic isolation
    will shape the patterns of introgression in hybrid zones, leading to variable
    outcomes depending on the genetic mechanism involved. Here, we analysed experimental
    and natural hybrid populations of Aegilops geniculata and Aegilops triuncialis
    to examine the genetics of species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Because
    long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) showing differential evolutionary
    trajectories are probably to affect hybrid dysgenesis and reproductive isolation
    between these wild wheat species, we addressed the impact of LTR-RTs in shaping
    introgression between them. Experimental settings involving artificial sympatry
    and enforced crossings quantified strong, but incomplete reproductive isolation,
    and highlighted asymmetrical endogenous postzygotic isolation between the two
    species. Natural hybrid zones located in the northern Golan Heights were analysed
    using plastid DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) marking random
    sequences, and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) tracking insertions
    from six LTR-RT families. This analysis demonstrated asymmetrical introgression
    and genome reorganization. In comparison with random sequences and quiescent LTR-RTs,
    those LTR-RTs predicted to be activated following conflicting interactions in
    hybrids revealed differential introgression across the hybrid zones. As also reported
    for synthetic F1 hybrids, such LTR-RTs were specifically reorganized in the genomes
    of viable hybrids, confirming that conflicts between selfish LTR-RTs may represent
    key incompatibilities shaping species boundaries and fostering long-term species
    integrity in the face of gene flow.

  Title: Differential introgression and reorganization of retrotransposons in hybrid
    zones between wild wheats
- Abstract: "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is usually followed by gene loss and karyotype\
    \ repatterning. Despite evidence of new adaptive traits associated with WGD, the\
    \ underpinnings and evolutionary significance of such genome fractionation remain\
    \ elusive. Here, we use Buckler mustard (Biscutella laevigata) to infer processes\
    \ that have driven the retention of duplicated genes after recurrent WGDs. In\
    \ addition to the \u03B2- and \u03B1-WGD events shared by all Brassicaceae, cytogenetic\
    \ and transcriptome analyses revealed two younger WGD events that occurred at\
    \ times of environmental changes in the clade of Buckler mustard (Biscutelleae):\
    \ a mesopolyploidy event from the late Miocene that was followed by considerable\
    \ karyotype reshuffling and chromosome number reduction and a neopolyploidy event\
    \ during the Pleistocene. Although a considerable number of the older duplicates\
    \ presented signatures of retention under positive selection, the majority of\
    \ retained duplicates arising from the younger mesopolyploidy WGD event matched\
    \ predictions of the gene balance hypothesis and showed evidence of strong purifying\
    \ selection as well as enrichment in gene categories responding to abiotic stressors.\
    \ Retention of large stretches of chromosomes for both genomic copies supported\
    \ the hypothesis that cycles of WGD and biased fractionation shaped the genome\
    \ of this stress-tolerant polypolyloid, promoting the adaptive recruitment of\
    \ stress-responding genes in the face of environmental challenges."

  Title: 'Current plant speciation research: unravelling the processes and mechanisms
    behind the evolution of reproductive isolation barriers'
- Abstract: Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) represent a major fraction
    of plant genomes, but processes leading to transposition bursts remain elusive.
    Polyploidy expectedly leads to LTR-RT proliferation, as the merging of divergent
    diploids provokes a genome shock activating LTR-RTs and/or genetic redundancy
    supports the accumulation of active LTR-RTs through relaxation of selective constraints.
    Available evidence supports interspecific hybridization as the main trigger of
    genome dynamics, but few studies have addressed the consequences of intraspecific
    polyploidy (i.e. autopolyploidy), where the genome shock is expectedly minimized.
    The dynamics of LTR-RTs was thus here evaluated through low coverage 454 sequencing
    of three closely related diploid progenitors and three independent autotetraploids
    from the young Biscutella laevigata species complex. Genomes from this early diverging
    Brassicaceae lineage presented a minimum of 40% repeats and a large diversity
    of transposable elements. Differential abundances and patterns of sequence divergence
    among genomes for 37 LTR-RT families revealed contrasted dynamics during species
    diversification. Quiescent LTR-RT families with limited genetic variation among
    genomes were distinguished from active families (37.8%) having proliferated in
    specific taxa. Specific families proliferated in autopolyploids only, but most
    transpositionally active families in polyploids were also differentiated among
    diploids. Low expression levels of transpositionally active LTR-RT families in
    autopolyploids further supported that genome shock and redundancy are non-mutually
    exclusive triggers of LTR-RT proliferation. Although reputed stable, autopolyploid
    genomes show LTR-RT fractions presenting analogies with polyploids between widely
    divergent genomes.

  Title: Evolutionary dynamics of retrotransposons following autopolyploidy in the
    Buckler Mustard species complex
- Abstract: Interspecific hybridization leads to new interactions among divergent
    genomes, revealing the nature of genetic incompatibilities having accumulated
    during and after the origin of species. Conflicts associated with misregulation
    of transposable elements (TEs) in hybrids expectedly result in their activation
    and genome-wide changes that may be key to species boundaries. Repetitive genomes
    of wild wheats have diverged under differential dynamics of specific long terminal
    repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), offering unparalleled opportunities to address
    the underpinnings of plant genome reorganization by selfish sequences. Using reciprocal
    F1 hybrids between three Aegilops species, restructuring and epigenetic repatterning
    was assessed at random and LTR-RT sequences with amplified fragment length polymorphism
    and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms as well as their methylation-sensitive
    counterparts, respectively. Asymmetrical reorganization of LTR-RT families predicted
    to cause conflicting interactions matched differential survival of F1 hybrids.
    Consistent with the genome shock model, increasing divergence of merged LTR-RTs
    yielded higher levels of changes in corresponding genome fractions and lead to
    repeated reorganization of LTR-RT sequences in F1 hybrids. Such non-random reorganization
    of hybrid genomes is coherent with the necessary repression of incompatible TE
    loci in support of hybrid viability and indicates that TE-driven genomic conflicts
    may represent an overlooked factor supporting reproductive isolation.

  Title: 'Wheat alleles introgress into selfing wild relatives: empirical estimates
    from approximate Bayesian computation in Aegilops triuncialis'
- Abstract: Crossing experiments indicate that hybrid sterility barriers frequently
    have developed within diploid, circumpolar plant species of the genus Draba. To
    gain insight into the rapid evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation in
    this system, we augmented the linkage map of one of these species, D. nivalis,
    and searched for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with reproductive isolation.
    The map adds 63 new dominant markers to a previously published dataset of 31 co-dominant
    microsatellites. These markers include 52 amplified fragment length polymorphisms
    (AFLPs) and 11 sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAPs) based on retrotransposon
    sequence. 22 markers displaying transmission ratio distortion were further included
    in the map. We resolved eight linkage groups with a total map length of 894 cM.
    Significant genotype-trait associations, or quantitative trait loci (QTL), were
    detected for reproductive phenotypes including pollen fertility (4 QTLs), seed
    set (3 QTLs), flowering time (3 QTLs) and number of flowers (4 QTLs). Observed
    patterns of inheritance were consistent with the influence of both nuclear-nuclear
    interactions and chromosomal changes on these traits. All seed set QTLs and one
    pollen fertility QTL displayed underdominant effects suggestive of the involvement
    of chromosomal rearrangements in hybrid sterility. Interestingly, D. nivalis is
    predominantly self-fertilizing, which may facilitate the establishment of underdominant
    loci and contribute to reproductive isolation.

  Title: Genetics of cryptic speciation within an Arctic mustard, Draba nivalis
- Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) are expectedly central to genome evolution.
    To assess the impact of TEs in driving genome turnover, we used allopolyploid
    genomes, showing considerable deviation from the predicted additivity of their
    diploid progenitors and thus having undergone major restructuring. Genome survey
    sequencing was used to select 17 putatively active families of long terminal repeat
    retrotransposons. Genome-wide TE insertions were genotyped with sequence-specific
    amplified polymorphism (SSAP) in diploid progenitors and their derived polyploids,
    and compared with changes in random sequences to assess restructuring of four
    independent Aegilops allotetraploid genomes. Generally, TEs with different evolutionary
    trajectories from those of random sequences were identified. Thus, TEs presented
    family-specific and species-specific dynamics following polyploidy, as illustrated
    by Sabine showing proliferation in particular polyploids, but massive elimination
    in others. Contrasting with that, only a few families (BARE1 and Romani) showed
    proliferation in all polyploids. Overall, TE divergence between progenitors was
    strongly correlated with the degree of restructuring in polyploid TE fractions.
    TE families present evolutionary trajectories that are decoupled from genome-wide
    changes after allopolyploidy and have a pervasive impact on their restructuring.

  Title: Contrasting evolutionary trajectories of multiple retrotransposons following
    independent allopolyploidy in wild wheats
- Abstract: Transposable elements (TE) represent a major fraction of eukaryotic genomes
    and play many roles in plant epigenetics. In this chapter, we describe the use
    of Sequence-Specific Amplified Polymorphism (SSAP) as a reliable Transposon Display
    technique applicable for use in many plant species. We also discuss the interpretation
    of SSAP data and associated risks. This technique has potential to allow rapid
    screening of plant populations, especially in nonmodel or wild species.

  Title: Detecting epigenetic effects of transposable elements in plants
- Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) usually represent the most abundant and dynamic
    fraction of genomes in almost all living organisms. The overall capacity of such
    'junk DNA' to induce mutations and foster the reorganization of functional genomes
    suggests that TE may be of central evolutionary significance. However, to what
    extent TE dynamics drive and is driven by the evolutionary trajectory of host
    taxa remains poorly known. Further work addressing the fate of TE insertions in
    natural populations is necessary to shed light on their impact on microevolutionary
    processes. Here, we highlight methodological approaches (i.e. transposon displays
    and high-throughput sequencing), tracking TE insertions across large numbers of
    individuals and discuss their pitfalls and benefits for molecular ecology surveys.

  Title: Transposable elements and microevolutionary changes in natural populations
- Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) represent a major fraction of plant genomes
    and drive their evolution. An improved understanding of genome evolution requires
    the dynamics of a large number of TE families to be considered. We put forward
    an approach bypassing the required step of a complete reference genome to assess
    the evolutionary trajectories of high copy number TE families from genome snapshot
    with high-throughput sequencing. Low coverage sequencing of the complex genomes
    of Aegilops cylindrica and Ae. geniculata using 454 identified more than 70% of
    the sequences as known TEs, mainly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons.
    Comparing the abundance of reads as well as patterns of sequence diversity and
    divergence within and among genomes assessed the dynamics of 44 major LTR retrotransposon
    families of the 165 identified. In particular, molecular population genetics on
    individual TE copies distinguished recently active from quiescent families and
    highlighted different evolutionary trajectories of retrotransposons among related
    species. This work presents a suite of tools suitable for current sequencing data,
    allowing to address the genome-wide evolutionary dynamics of TEs at the family
    level and advancing our understanding of the evolution of nonmodel genomes.

  Title: Evolutionary dynamics of retrotransposons assessed by high-throughput sequencing
    in wild relatives of wheat
- Abstract: Evidence accumulated over the last decade has shown that allopolyploid
    genomes may undergo drastic reorganization. However, timing and mechanisms of
    structural diploidization over evolutionary timescales are still poorly known.
    As transposable elements (TEs) represent major and labile components of plant
    genomes, they likely play a pivotal role in fuelling genome changes leading to
    long-term diploidization. Here, we exploit the 4.5 MY old allopolyploid Nicotiana
    section Repandae to investigate the impact of TEs on the evolutionary dynamics
    of genomes. Sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) on seven TEs with
    expected contrasted dynamics were used to survey genome-wide TE insertion polymorphisms.
    Comparisons of TE insertions in the four allopolyploid species and descendents
    of the diploid species most closely related to their actual progenitors revealed
    that the polyploids showed considerable departure from predicted additivity of
    the diploids. Large numbers of new SSAP bands were observed in polyploids for
    two TEs, but restructuring for most TE families involved substantial loss of fragments
    relative to the genome of the diploid representing the paternal progenitor, which
    could be due to changes in allopolyploids, diploid progenitor lineages or both.
    The majority of non-additive bands were shared by all polyploid species, suggesting
    that significant restructuring occurred early after the allopolyploid event that
    gave rise to their common ancestor. Furthermore, several gains and losses of SSAP
    fragments were restricted to N. repanda, suggesting a unique evolutionary trajectory.
    This pattern of diploidization in TE genome fractions supports the hypothesis
    that TEs are central to long-term genome turnover and depends on both TE and the
    polyploid lineage considered.

  Title: Polyploids integrate genomic changes and ecological shifts. 13th Congress
    of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology, Tuebingen, Germany, August 2011
- Abstract: Gene flow between domesticated species and their wild relatives is receiving
    growing attention. This study addressed introgression between wheat and natural
    populations of its wild relatives (Aegilops species). The sampling included 472
    individuals, collected from 32 Mediterranean populations of three widespread Aegilops
    species (Aegilops geniculata, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis) and compared wheat
    field borders to areas isolated from agriculture. Individuals were characterized
    with amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting, analysed through two
    computational approaches (i.e. Bayesian estimations of admixture and fuzzy clustering),
    and sequences marking wheat-specific insertions of transposable elements. With
    this combined approach, we detected substantial gene flow between wheat and Aegilops
    species. Specifically, Ae. neglecta and Ae. triuncialis showed significantly more
    admixed individuals close to wheat fields than in locations isolated from agriculture.
    In contrast, little evidence of gene flow was found in Ae. geniculata. Our results
    indicated that reproductive barriers have been regularly bypassed during the long
    history of sympatry between wheat and Aegilops.

  Title: 'Gene flow between wheat and wild relatives: empirical evidence from Aegilops

- Abstract: '*This study reconstructs the phylogeography of Aegilops geniculata, an
    allotetraploid relative of wheat, to discuss the impact of past climate changes
    and recent human activities (e.g. the early expansion of agriculture) on the genetic
    diversity of ruderal plant species. *We combined chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing,
    analysed using statistical parsimony network, with nonhierarchical K-means clustering
    of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping, to unravel patterns
    of genetic structure across the native range of Ae. geniculata. The AFLP dataset
    was further explored by measurement of the regional genetic diversity and the
    detection of isolation by distance patterns. *Both cpDNA and AFLP suggest an eastern
    Mediterranean origin of Ae. geniculata. Two lineages have spread independently
    over northern and southern Mediterranean areas. Northern populations show low
    genetic diversity but strong phylogeographical structure among the main peninsulas,
    indicating a major influence of glacial cycles. By contrast, low genetic structuring
    and a high genetic diversity are detected in southern Mediterranean populations.
    Finally, we highlight human-mediated dispersal resulting in substantial introgression
    between resident and migrant populations. *We have shown that the evolutionary
    trajectories of ruderal plants can be similar to those of wild species, but are
    interfered by human activities, promoting range expansions through increased long-distance
    dispersal and the creation of suitable habitats.'

  Title: Origin and expansion of the allotetraploid Aegilops geniculata, a wild relative
    of wheat
- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications, such as cytosine methylation, are
    inherited in plant species and may occur in response to biotic or abiotic stress,
    affecting gene expression without changing genome sequence. Laguncularia racemosa,
    a mangrove species, occurs in naturally contrasting habitats where it is subjected
    daily to salinity and nutrient variations leading to morphological differences.
    This work aims at unraveling how CpG-methylation variation is distributed among
    individuals from two nearby habitats, at a riverside (RS) or near a salt marsh
    (SM), with different environmental pressures and how this variation is correlated
    with the observed morphological variation.

    PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Significant differences were observed in morphological traits
    such as tree height, tree diameter, leaf width and leaf area between plants from
    RS and SM locations, resulting in smaller plants and smaller leaf size in SM plants.
    Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) was used to assess genetic and
    epigenetic (CpG-methylation) variation in L. racemosa genomes from these populations.
    SM plants were hypomethylated (14.6% of loci had methylated samples) in comparison
    to RS (32.1% of loci had methylated samples). Within-population diversity was
    significantly greater for epigenetic than genetic data in both locations, but
    SM also had less epigenetic diversity than RS. Frequency-based (G(ST)) and multivariate
    (beta(ST)) methods that estimate population structure showed significantly greater
    differentiation among locations for epigenetic than genetic data. Co-Inertia analysis,
    exploring jointly the genetic and epigenetic data, showed that individuals with
    similar genetic profiles presented divergent epigenetic profiles that were characteristic
    of the population in a particular environment, suggesting that CpG-methylation
    changes may be associated with environmental heterogeneity.

    CONCLUSIONS: In spite of significant morphological dissimilarities, individuals
    of L. racemosa from salt marsh and riverside presented little genetic but abundant
    DNA methylation differentiation, suggesting that epigenetic variation in natural
    plant populations has an important role in helping individuals to cope with different
    environments.'

  Title: Epigenetic variation in mangrove plants occurring in contrasting natural
    environment
- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Knowledge on how climate-induced range shifts might
    affect natural selection is crucial to understand the evolution of species ranges.

    METHODS: Using historical demographic perspectives gathered from regional-scale
    phylogeography on the alpine herb Biscutella laevigata, indirect inferences on
    gene flow and signature of selection based on AFLP genotyping were compared between
    local populations persisting at the trailing edge and expanding at the leading
    edge.

    KEY RESULTS: Spatial autocorrelation revealed that gene flow was two times more
    restricted at the trailing edge and genome scans indicated divergent selection
    in this persisting population. In contrast, no pattern of selection emerged in
    the expanding population at the leading edge.

    CONCLUSIONS: Historical effects may determine different architecture of genetic
    variation and selective patterns within local populations, what is arguably important
    to understand evolutionary processes acting across the species ranges.'

  Title: Divergent selection in trailing- versus leading-edge populations of Biscutella
    laevigata
- Abstract: Autopolyploidy is more common in plants than traditionally assumed, but
    has received little attention compared with allopolyploidy. Hence, the advantages
    and disadvantages of genome doubling per se compared with genome doubling coupled
    with hybridizations in allopolyploids remain unclear. Autopolyploids are characterized
    by genomic redundancy and polysomic inheritance, increasing effective population
    size. To shed light on the evolutionary consequences of autopolyploidy, we review
    a broad range of studies focusing on both synthetic and natural autopolyploids
    encompassing levels of biological organization from genes to evolutionary lineages.
    The limited evidence currently available suggests that autopolyploids neither
    experience strong genome restructuring nor wide reorganization of gene expression
    during the first generations following genome doubling, but that these processes
    may become more important in the longer term. Biogeographic and ecological surveys
    point to an association between the formation of autopolyploid lineages and environmental
    change. We thus hypothesize that polysomic inheritance may provide a short-term
    evolutionary advantage for autopolyploids compared to diploid relatives when environmental
    change enforces range shifts. In addition, autopolyploids should possess increased
    genome flexibility, allowing them to adapt and persist across heterogeneous landscapes
    in the long run.

  Title: Evolutionary consequences of autopolyploidy
- Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) represent an important fraction of plant genomes
    and are likely to play a pivotal role in fuelling genome reorganization and functional
    changes following allopolyploidization. Various processes associated with allopolyploidy
    (i.e. genetic redundancy, bottlenecks during the formation of allopolyploids or
    genome shock following genome merging) may allow accumulation of TE insertions.
    Our objective in carrying out a survey of the literature and a comparative analysis
    across different allopolyploid systems is to shed light on the structural, epigenetic
    and functional modifications driven by TEs during allopolyploidization and subsequent
    diploidization. The available evidence indicates that TE proliferation in the
    short or the long term after allopolyploidization may be restricted to a few TEs,
    in specific polyploid systems. By contrast, data indicate major structural changes
    in the TE genome fraction immediately after allopolyploidization, mainly through
    losses of TE sequences as a result of recombination. Emerging evidence also suggests
    that TEs are targeted by substantial epigenetic changes, which may impact gene
    expression and genome stability. Furthermore, TEs may directly or indirectly support
    the evolution of new functionalities in allopolyploids during diploidization.
    All data stress allopolyploidization as a shock associated with drastic genome
    reorganization. Mechanisms controlling TEs during allopolyploidization as well
    as their impact on diploidization are discussed.

  Title: Impact of transposable elements on the organization and function of allopolyploid
    genomes
- Abstract: '*Transposable elements (TE) induce structural and epigenetic alterations
    in their host genome, with major evolutionary implications. These alterations
    are examined here in the context of allopolyploid speciation, on the recently
    formed invasive species Spartina anglica, which represents an excellent model
    to contrast plant genome dynamics following hybridization and genome doubling
    in natural conditions. *Methyl-sensitive transposon display was used to investigate
    the structural and epigenetic dynamics of TE insertion sites for several elements,
    and to contrast it with comparable genome-wide methyl-sensitive amplified polymorphism
    analyses. *While no transposition burst was detected, we found evidence of major
    structural and CpG methylation changes in the vicinity of TE insertions accompanying
    hybridization, and to a lesser extent, genome doubling. Genomic alteration appeared
    preferentially in the maternal subgenome, and the environment of TEs was specifically
    affected by large maternal-specific methylation changes, demonstrating that TEs
    fuel epigenetic alterations at the merging of diverged genomes. *Such genome changes
    indicate that nuclear incompatibilities in Spartina trigger immediate alterations,
    which are TE-specific with an important epigenetic component. Since most of this
    reorganization is conserved after genome doubling that produced a fertile invasive
    species, TEs certainly play a central role in the shock-induced dynamics of the
    genome during allopolyploid speciation.'

  Title: Rapid structural and epigenetic reorganization near transposable elements
    in hybrid and allopolyploid genomes in Spartina
- Abstract: Gene flow, drift and selection can be detected through different signatures
    across the genome and the landscape. Genetic discontinuities along with their
    correlation to environmental features can be used to tease out isolation-by-distance
    and isolation-by-time from processes related to selection. Using spatial statistics
    (spatial autocorrelation methods, canonical correspondence analysis and partial
    Mantel tests) dealing with genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism
    (AFLP) under unlikely Hardy-Weinberg assumptions, this study investigates 124
    individuals within a continuous population of the autopolyploid Biscutella laevigata
    (Brassicaceae). Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was strong and the mosaic-like
    distribution of AFLP genotypes was consistently associated with habitat factors,
    even when controlled for geographical distances. The use of multivariate analyses
    enabled separation of the factors responsible for the repartition of the genetic
    variance and revealed a composite effect of isolation by distance, phenological
    divergence and local adaptation to habitats characterised by different solar radiation
    regimes. These results suggest that the immigrant inviability barrier facilitated
    the maintenance of adapted subpopulations to distinct environmental conditions
    at the local scale.

  Title: Genome-wide association to fine-scale ecological heterogeneity within a continuous
    population of Biscutella laevigata (Brassicaceae)
- Abstract: Past climatic changes and especially the ice ages have had a great impact
    on both the distribution and the genetic composition of plant populations, but
    whether they promoted speciation is still controversial. The autopolyploid complex
    Biscutella laevigata is a classical example of polyploidy linked to glaciations
    and is an interesting model to explore migration and speciation driven by climate
    changes in a complex alpine landscape. Diploid taxa survived the last glacial
    maximum in several never-glaciated areas and autotetraploids are clearly dominant
    in the central parts of the Alps; however, previous range-wide studies failed
    to identify their diploid ancestor(s). This study highlights the phylogeographical
    relationships of maternal lineages in the Western Alps and investigates the polyploidy
    process using plastid DNA sequences (trnS-trnG and trnK-intron) combined with
    plastid DNA length polymorphism markers, which were transferable among Brassicaceae
    species. Twenty-one distinct plastid DNA haplotypes were distinguished in 67 populations
    densely sampled in the Western Alps and main lineages were identified by a median-joining
    network. The external Alps harboured high levels of genetic diversity, while the
    Central Alps contained only a subset of haplotypes due to postglacial recolonization.
    Several haplotypes were restricted to local peripheral refugia and evidence of
    in situ survival in central nunataks was detected by the presence of highly differentiated
    haplotypes swamped by frequent ones. As hierarchical genetic structure pointed
    to an independent evolution of the species in different biogeographical districts,
    and since tetraploids displayed haplotypes belonging to different lineages restricted
    to either the northern or the southern parts of the Alpine chain, polytopic autopolyploidy
    was also apparent in the Western Alps.

  Title: Glacial in situ survival in the Western Alps and polytopic autopolyploidy
    in Biscutella laevigata L. (Brassicaceae)
- Abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The long-lived and mainly outcrossing species Sarracenia
    purpurea has been introduced into Switzerland and become invasive. This creates
    the opportunity to study reactions to founder effect and how a species can circumvent
    deleterious effects of bottlenecks such as reduced genetic diversity, inbreeding
    and extinction through mutational meltdown, to emerge as a highly invasive plant.

    METHODS: A population genetic survey by random amplified polymorphism DNA markers
    (RAPD) together with historical insights and a field pollination experiment were
    carried out.

    KEY RESULTS: At the regional scale, S. purpurea shows low structure (thetast=0.072)
    due to a recent founder event and important subsequent growth. Nevertheless, multivariate
    statistical analyses reveal that, because of a bottleneck that shifted allele
    frequencies, most of the variability is independent among populations. In one
    population (Tenasses) the species has become invasive and genetic analysis reveals
    restricted gene flow and family structure (thetast=0.287). Although inbreeding
    appears to be high (Fis >0.410 from a Bayesian estimation), a field pollination
    experiment failed to detect significant inbreeding depression upon F1 seed number
    and seed weight fitness-traits. Furthermore, crosses between unrelated individuals
    produced F1 seeds with significantly reduced fitness, thus showing local outbreeding
    depression.

    CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, under restricted gene flow among families,
    the species may not only have rapidly purged deleterious alleles, but also have
    undergone some form of selection for inbreeding due to co-adaptation between loci.'
