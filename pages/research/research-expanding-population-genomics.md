With the GeneScale consortium, we develop landscape genomics on alpine populations of <en>Arabis alpina</en> by associating genetic variation and environmental heterogeneity characterized at high resolution. Multi-scale decomposition tackles the effective scale of natural selection.

With Kim Gilbert, we investigate the evolutionary consequences of population expansion on genomic variation in <en>Arabis alpina</en>. Integrating simulations of complex demographic scenarios with sequence data from several hundred field samples, we address the impact of selection and particularly the accumulation of deleterious mutations during climate-induced range expansion.
