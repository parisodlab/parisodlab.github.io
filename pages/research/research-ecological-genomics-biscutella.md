Colonization of alpine landscapes by Buckler Mustards (<em>Biscutella laevigata</em>; Brassicaceae) has been associated with recurrent whole genome duplications, dynamics of transposable elements and adaptive evolution of stress-responding genes. We focus on this mixed-ploidy model system to integrate genomic and ecological changes associated with autopolyploid speciation.  
  
In particular, we currently use natural as well as experimental populations of diploids and autopolyploids to address underpinnings of their radiation under environmental constraints inherent to elevation and soil toxicity gradients.  
  
Our research combines fieldwork, greenhouse experiments, and molecular biology to investigate the ecological genomics of diploid and polyploid plants.
